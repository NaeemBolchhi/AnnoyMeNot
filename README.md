# AnnoyMeNot: An Annoyance Filter for uBlock Origin

AnnoyMeNot is a custom filter for uBlock Origin that, once subcribed to, will cosmetically remove annoyances around the web. This is a personal project meant to improve my experience on the websites I frequent.

## Introduction

AnnoyMeNot is built off of the custom filter option already available in uBlock Origin. Paired with plain-old CSS selectors, it can cosmetically remove bits of the web that only harm the user experience. This includes ads that are not filtered out by uBlock Origin in default settings, triggers and popups, and basically anything that could be called an annoyance.

The filter does not use host blocking, and would be impossible to use with a host blocker. It is meant for the browser, and only for uBlock Origin. I will improve the filter as I find new annoyances.

## Install

As this filter is for uBlock Origin, you need to first install uBlock Origin in your Web Browser.

#### (1) Install uBlock Origin for your browser
